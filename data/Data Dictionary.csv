"Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) Data Portal View (Parent Data Only)","These data provide areas designated by HRSA as having shortages of primary care, dental care, or mental health providers. HRSAâ€™s Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) develops shortage designation criteria and uses them to decide whether or not a geographic area or population group is a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), Medically Underserved Area (MUA), or Medically Underserved Population (MUP). More than 34 federal programs depend on HPSA/MUA/MUP designations to determine eligibility or as a funding preference. About 20 percent of the U.S. population resides in primary medical care HPSAs. HPSAs may have shortages of primary medical care, dental, or mental health providers; may be urban or rural areas; population groups; or medical or other public facilities."
"DP_PRIMARY_ID","This attribute represents the HRSA Data Warehouse (HDW) key converted to a text string used to crosswalk to a related dataset within the HDW Data Portal."
"HPSA Name","This attribute represents the title case format, user friendly name which is generated by decoding the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) name which came directly from the source system."
"HPSA ID","This attribute represents the primary identifier for a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) as a complete unit in the source data system."
"Designation Type","This attribute represents the textual description of the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) type."
"HPSA Discipline Class","This attribute represents the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) discipline class description. HPSA disciplines may be listed as Primary Care, Dental Health, or Mental Health."
"HPSA Score","This attribute represents the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) Score developed by the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) in determining priorities for assignment of clinicians. The scores range from 0 to 26 where the higher the score, the greater the priority."
"Primary State Abbreviation","This attribute represents the two alphabetic character code established by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for identifying U.S. states or U.S. territories which is associated with the location of the parent or primary entity. With respect to a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) or a Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P), the physical land area associated with the entity may cross state boundaries, which means a HPSA or MUA/P may consist of components or parts from one or more states. Therefore, the primary state for one of these areas is the state associated with the parent or primary record. Also, the primary state is used for aggregating counts and sums at the state level."
"HPSA Status","This attribute represents the textual description of the current status of the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designation."
"HPSA Designation Date","This attribute represents the date on which the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) was originally designated as a shortage area."

"HPSA Population Type","This attribute represents the population type description which characterizes the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA)."
"HPSA Degree of Shortage","This attribute represents the degree of practitioner shortage for the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) based on population to provider ratio."
"# of FTEs Short","This attribute represents the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) practitioners needed in the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) so that it will achieve the population to practitioner target ratio. The target ratio is determined by the type (discipline) of the HPSA."
"HPSA Designation Population","This attribute represents the number of persons which have been identified by the HRSA, Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW), Division of Policy and Shortage Designation (DPSD) as being affected by the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA)."
"% of Population Below 100% Poverty","This attribute represents the percent of the population in the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) living below the U.S. Federal Poverty Level (USFPL)."
"HPSA Formal Ratio","This attribute represents the ratio of the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) Designation Population to HPSA provider full-time equivalents displayed in ratio format (for example, 3500:1), where the population and the designation share the same discipline class (for example, Primary Care, Dental Care, and Mental Health)."
"Street Address","This attribute represents the street address where the entity is physically located."

Therefore, the primary state for one of these areas is the state associated with the parent or primary record. Also, the primary state is used for aggregating counts and sums at the state level."
"Rural Status","This attribute represents the rural status description for the entity (such as a facility or a geographic area)."
